# Credit Card Fraud Detection.

In today's world, the CARDs industry has been one of the major revenue earning business in the Banking and the Finance industry. It has also been the most favorable payment menthod among customers becuase of the ease in carrying it and at the same time being super efficient in terms of transaction completion time and transaction approval rate. Almost every bank issuing a credit card assures around 98 to 99 percent of transaction approval rate. Because of these factors, the customers are encouraged and prefer to use credit cards in the first place. 

But, in the recent times, one of the major issue that the financial services industry is facing is around Fraud/scams. As stated in Romexsoft's "The Ultimate Guide To Credit Card Fraud Detection in Banking" site, "On a global scale, credit card processing fraud has hit $32.320 trillion in total, with $21.84 billion lost in the US only."

So, it is very important for the Banking and the Finance industry to take proactive measures in identifying Fraudulant Credit Card transactions as it not only affects the banks revenue, but also impacts the financial stability of it's customers.

In this project, I am analysing a large data set on Credit Card data and with use of various Machine Learning algorithms, build the best classification model to classify each transaction as Fradulent or Genuine.
